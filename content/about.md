## Tekniker vi använder

__Pico__

Pico is a flat file CMS. This means there is no administration backend or
database to deal with. You simply create `.md` files in the `content` folder
and those files become your pages. For example, this file is called `about.md`
and is shown as the main landing page.

__twig__

Twig is a template engine for the PHP programming language. Its syntax originates from Jinja and Django templates. It's an open source product licensed under a BSD License and maintained by Fabien Potencier.

__scss__

SCSS, also known as Sassy CSS is one of the two syntax available to write Sass. Sass is a popular CSS preprossing language to generate CSS files.

With Sass, you can reduce the number of times you repeat yourself and ensure you’re writing clean, maintainable code for the future. It also allows us to do math using operators. We can perform simple calculations inside our code for better output.

__Markdown__

Markdown makes it easier to format text for web pages because its tags are simpler than HTML, and they convert to HTML automatically. This means you don’t have to know HTML to write something for a web page because Markdown translates your tags into HTML for you

__stylintr__

is a tool that analyzes source code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs.

__Git and GitHub__

We use Git to save our file version localy, and GitHub to push our different version. To be able to see what was update each time.
