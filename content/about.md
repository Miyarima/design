__Pico__

"[Pico](%base_url%?docs) is a flat file CMS. This means there is no administration backend or
database to deal with. You simply create `.md` files in the `content` folder
and those files become your pages. For example, this file is called `about.md`
and is shown as the main landing page."

__twig__

Twig is a template engine for the PHP programming language. 

__scss__

SCSS, is also know as Sassy CSS. Which is one of two syntaxes available to write 
Sass. Sass is a CSS preprossing laguage that generate CSS files.

Sass makes it eaiser to not repat yourself and ensures you're writing clean, 
maintainble code. You can also use math operatos to perform simple calculations
inside you CSS code.

__Markdown__

Markdown is a way to make HTML files simpler. It makes it easier by having simpler
tags, then HTML, and automatically convert it to HTML. In other words, you don't
need to know any HTML to write something for a web page since Markdown converts the
tags into HTML for you.

__stylintr__

is a tool that analyzes source code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors,
and suspicious constructs to make all files follow the same rule set.

__Git and GitHub__

We use Git to save our file versions in a local repository, and GitHub to save our 
different versions in a remote repository. 

1. `git add .` Adding all files which have been modified.
2. `git status` Checking which files are ready to be commited.
3. `git commit -m "<commit message>"` Adding the commit.
4. `git push"` Pushing the commit to GitHub.
5. `git tag -a <version> -m "<tag message>"` Adding the tag.
5. `git push --tags` Pushing the tags to GitHub.
